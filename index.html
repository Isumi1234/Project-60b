        <p>My favourite hobby is reading is an interesting and knowledgeable thing to do. Readig can take you to many different places as from Gotham City to Everglen. I like to read after I am done doing my homework or if I just have some spare time. I personally enjoy reading fiction books because it build a good imagniation in me and I enjoy reading different fiction things like different realms and different human/other creatures abilities. Reading books is one way that keeps me happy, interested in what I do and busy.</p>
